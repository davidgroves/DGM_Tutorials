counter = 1

while counter <= 1000:
    total = total + counter
    counter = counter + 1

# For Super Extra Credit.
# Pair numbers at each end of the spectrum, like :-
# 1 and 1000, 2 and 999, 3 and 998 etc ...
# Each of these pairs adds up to 1001.
#
# 1 + 1000 = 1001
# 2 + 999  = 1001
# 3 + 998  = 1001
#
# You will have 500 pairs of these numbers.
# So the total will be 500 * 1001 = 500500.
#
# This should be the same as your program.
